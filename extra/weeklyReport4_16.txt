   Summary
      This week we meet up at the MLK Library to discuss how we will split up the tasks of the project. We started creating a simple list of use cases, and a list of classes that we may need in the program design. We set up a Github repository so we could all easily contribute to the program and stay up to date. Because we had technical difficulties and other prior scheduling responsibilities, we ended the meeting after 2 hours and decided to all connect to the repository this weekend and then meet up the following Tuesday.
